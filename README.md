# AutoRunner
Autorunner is a lightweight desktop application that automates character movement in games. It’s useful for games where holding movement keys for a long time is required.

The app tracks the state of selected keys and lets you toggle “autorun” on or off with a hotkey. Keybindings and preferences (such as start and quit keys) are automatically saved in AppData, so they persist between sessions.

Features:
- Customizable hotkeys for start and stop.
- Automatic saving of user preferences.
- Simple Tkinter interface with minimal dependencies.
- Event-driven keyboard handling without continuous polling.
